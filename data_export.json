He taught himself programming as a teenager, sold his first software at 12, and later read textbooks and research papers on rockets until he understood them deeply enough to build SpaceX. No formal aerospace degree. Just relentless curiosity and disciplined self-study.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare had no university education. Through self-reading, observation, and practice, he mastered language so profoundly that centuries later, the world still studies his work. He proved that learning doesn't require elite institutions - only commitment.\n\nMichael Faraday, one of the greatest scientists in history, was once a bookbinder's apprentice. He educated himself by reading the very books he bound. His self-learning laid the foundation for modern electricity.\n\nNow fast-forward to today.\n\nProgramming is one of the most self-learnable skills in history.\nThe internet is your library.\nOpen-source is your classroom.\nProjects are your exams.\n\nYou can:\n\nLearn Python from free tutorials\n\nBuild real apps by following documentation\n\nContribute to open-source projects\n\nFail, fix, repeat - and grow\n\nSelf-directed code learning is not about being naturally smart.\nIt's about consistency, curiosity, and courage.\n\nIf you can read, think, and persist - you can code.\nIf you can code - you can build.\nIf you can build - you can change your life.\n\nDon't wait for the right time or the perfect course.\nStart where you are. Learn one concept. Write one line of code.\n\nHistory favors the self-taught.\nThe future belongs to those who teach themselves.\n\nYou can become a programmer - by yourself.\nStart today.",     "excerpt": "History favors the self-taught.

They're full of legacy code, undocumented behavior, and temporary fixes from 3 years ago.\n\nOverconfidence in wrong answers\nAI is great at sounding confident - even when it's wrong. In prod, confident mistakes are expensive.\n\nSecurity & compliance blind spots\nAI may suggest patterns that violate security policies, data handling rules, or compliance requirements.\n\nOwnership during incidents\nWhen production goes down, AI doesn't join the incident call, assess business impact, or make trade-off decisions under pressure.\n\nThe takeaway:\nAI is an accelerator - not a decision-maker.\n\nIn production, judgment beats speed.\nExperience beats suggestions.\nAccountability beats automation.\n\nThe best teams don't replace engineers with AI.\nThey use AI to support engineers who understand the system deeply.",     "excerpt": "The best teams don't replace engineers with AI.

As a powerful open-source toolkit, it facilitates the development of responsive and modern websites, emphasizing both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Join us as we delve into the simplicity and versatility Bootstrap offers in web development.</p><p><br></p><p><b>A Brief on Bootstrap: The Go-To Framework</b></p><p>Developed by Twitter engineers, Bootstrap quickly ascended to become the go-to framework for developers around the world. Its strength lies in its grid system, ready-to-use components, and jQuery plugins, offering a straightforward path to create visually appealing and responsive designs.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Grid System: Structuring Your Content</b></p><p>At the heart of Bootstrap lies a dynamic grid system based on a 12-column layout, facilitating a seamless organization of content. It offers developers the flexibility to arrange components fluidly across various devices, ensuring optimal viewing experiences from smartphones to desktops. Mastering the grid system means stepping into a realm where meticulous layouts become effortlessly achievable.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Responsive Design: A Mobile-First Approach</b></p><p>Bootstrap adopts a mobile-first philosophy, where designs are created with smaller screens in mind before scaling up for larger displays. This approach ensures that your website maintains a coherent design and user experience across all device types, a non-negotiable in todayÆs mobile-dominant world.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Components and Utilities: Ready, Set, Develop!</b></p><p>One of Bootstrap's standout features is its extensive library of pre-designed components and utilities. From navigation bars to modals and tooltips, Bootstrap offers a plethora of elements that can be customized and integrated into your web projects swiftly. This pre-built treasure trove means you spend less time on the nitty-gritty details and more on realizing your vision.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Customization: Making Bootstrap Your Own</b></p><p>While Bootstrap offers a rich set of features out of the box, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Luckily, Bootstrap provides avenues for customization, allowing developers to tweak variables, modify predefined classes, and even create new ones to tailor the framework to specific needs. Thus, you can retain a unique flavor in your designs while enjoying Bootstrap's conveniences.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Getting Started: Your First Bootstrap Project</b></p><p>Embarking on your Bootstrap journey is remarkably straightforward.
